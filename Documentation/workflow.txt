Shot'o'Movies




The current implementation flow is as follows:

1. User has to enter the name of the movies, for desired location.
2. If the movie name is valid then the list of location will be displayed with other movie details.
3. On click on to any movie location the user will be able to view the location on the google maps.



NOTE:

1. It reads the data from the XML file placed in the Data folder.
		Format of xml is taken from:
		Film Locations: https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am

	:: Although ,due to time constraint, the path of xml file has been hard coded in extractor (com.src.main.extractor.ReadData.java)

2. User has to input the correct movie name in order to search.
